# keyless-door-lock-with-bluetooth

This project consists of a smart door lock system. In this case we have developed a great solution to improve the Door lock system. how to operate this door lock is very easy. just bring the Bluetooth keyless that has been registered with the Mac Address into the Microcontroller, then connect the relay to be used to operate the active and inactive contacts of the magnetic door lock, because the magnetic door lock system will be active if it is given a 220V AC voltage. In this method, all data is controlled by Bluetooth keyless, ESP32 is used as Controller, we know that ESP32 has built-in Bluetooth and Wi-fi support.

# Hardware
